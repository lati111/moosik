# Moosik
A collection of small scale utility tools allowing for greater control over your spotify and youtube playlists. Primarily, it allows you to download a playlist in one go, as well as archiving of deleted videos (these will be kept in the `backup` folder for safekeeping, and will not be deleted unless the user does so manually.) 
Currently, features such as formatting are planned, but there is no timetable for that, as this is a hobby project primarily, and Python is not my primary language.
Downloaded playlists can be found in the playlists folder.

## How to install
1. Install [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't
2. Extract the downloaded zip file to a location of your choosing
3. Open a terminal in the installation location
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal
5. Open moosik.py and enjoy!
