# ytGameOstDownloader
A small python script I wrote to download a playlist of youtube songs, and reformat the name and metadata to display better on my car radio. 
By using user inputted formatting, it download and sorts the songs in the following format:
- cover: youtube thumbnail
- title: song name (removed things like dashes and numbers)
- artist: game series  (e.g. Legend of Zelda)
- album: game title (e.g. Ocarina of Time)

I probably won't really update this much, as this was mostly made for personal use.
